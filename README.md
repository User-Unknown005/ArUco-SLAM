# ArUco-SLAM

In this project i tried to implement 2D SLAM using ArUco markers, this piece of code uses openCV to detect the ArUco m,arkers and their orientation and prepares a relative mapping with them. 
The code creates a graph with the markers as nodes and connects them by aproximating the distance between them using vector calculations.
